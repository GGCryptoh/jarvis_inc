IGNORE THIS FILE!!!


if i make a public github to store skills, what license and readme should i paste in ?  readme you can output to
  screen.. repo for skills i will provide..   Official is one path on the skills i make... Marketplace will be the
  other path to curl and catalog etc, with skills refresh once a day when they visit the skills page or if they press
  a muted refresh icon thing... also i need the skills json like   create_image.json which has values like Author,
  Version, Title, Description, models array or single string, and since its a tool, a three way toggle of api_key,
  curl with params example, or cli tool etc... and details of the commands and their description etc... so we can
  build several json files for skills... also, the skills page per skill should have a test button that opens a nice
  dialog in the site theme to test the skill call and see results etc. some skills may need oauth connection so
  perhaps 4 options?  and save oauth to database etc...  what else?



add these todos.. 1) update TASKS.md   2) review @plan-surveillance.md  and if we dont need, remove it. but then
  make a folder called /AI/Surveillance.md which describes everyting you need to remember the look, feel, intent
  and things we want in the future..   3) make a new PLAN-SKILLS_REPO.md with all the info you need on this plan
  base don what i provided, put the license choice and readme and warranties etc we need in this file.. ill provide
   the repo placement later so we can make a folder called /seed_skills_repo/xxx.json with all the skills we have
  today in orfder to prep for swap to github loading of skills...   also 4) fully plan the CEO look and agent
  creation process and when teh CEO would demand we hire an agent to save money on tokens or whatever... then on
  hiring an agent, remember the CEO creates the system prompt for it, the description for tool agent calling, the
  date of hire, the plumbing needed to know what it is working on , iniital placement in floor plan, how it
  randomly initially sets the agent look and feel and name (user has ability to change later anyway), and the user
  prompt and assistant prompt for how you want data returned etc whatever you need.. plus a few options for the
  cron system scheduler process you need so we can choose... deep thinking here
