Consolidate these memories into a single concise summary. Preserve: specific names, numbers, dates, decisions, and outcomes. Remove: redundancy, greetings, process notes. The summary should be self-contained — someone reading it with no context should understand the key facts.

Return ONLY the consolidated summary text (1-3 sentences). No JSON, no formatting.
